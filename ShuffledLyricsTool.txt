I stick my hand into his shadow
Time to bring it down again.
To pull the pieces from the sand.
Learn to swim.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
Coming out the other side.
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA

Silly shit, stupid shit...
Days away I still feel you
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay.
Don't you fuckin lie.
By inch by loaded memory
Don't cry.
By coming home.
Don't you fuckin lie.
Hoping I can clear the way
Fuck you. Die. Bastard.
Cleansing I've endured within
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Eleven is standing still,
What's holding up is a mirror.
Cuz I'm praying for rain
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Clearing out what could've been.
You know I'm involved with black magic?
The snake behind me hisses
I don't want it.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
Soften this old armor.
How can it mean anything to me
I've missed you so much
Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still.
Step into the shadow.

Who am I to judge and strike you down?
Chasing the tail of dogma.
Fuck you. Fucking Americans, Yankee.
Eleven.
Will you? Will you now?
See my shadow changing,
I wanna see the ground give way.
You sure could yell.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Never wanna see that place again.
Don't just call me pessimist.

What is this but my reflection?
Digging through

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
knock you down,
doesn't mean fuck to me.
I can't stand to burn too long.
and claim what is mine.
Do unto you now what has been done to me.
My warning meant nothing.
But I'm so comfortable...Too comfortable.
while I smile and laugh and dance
my head down, my eyes closed,
It seems there's no other way out of this undertow.
while you
I hope it sucks you down.
and I want to trust
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. "If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin." Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too.
Shit adds up at the bottom.
it screams from deep beneath the endless water.
You've left me no choice but to go inside and rebuild
Do unto others what has been done to you
Get up and free yourself from yourself.
If I could I'd stick the knife in.
Thought the sun would come deliver me,
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow.
I hope it sucks you down.
and there was nothing I could say.
Slipped away from me.
I'm treading water,
I've been far too sympathetic.
You won't feel what you'd like to feel.
shrouding every breath I take,
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Noone even invited you in.
It's all I have left.
you know it hurt me,
See
Hatred, weakness, and guilt keep me alive
lost in euphoria.
And you my precious lamb and martyr.
And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber. And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possesed me then.
This is necessary.
I am just a worthless liar.
but there was nothing I could say.
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
but the truth has come to punish me instead.
You're dancing in quicksand.
divine destiny.
Say you won't go.
I'm on my knees and burning.
are crumbling images
I need you to feel this.
I must leave it behind,
And you may never come back again.
I just want to start things over.
But what you want and what you need
So smell my soul burning.
Trust me.
Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on........
It took so long to remember just what happened.
Let it go.
Thought I could make it end
Lay back and let me show you another way.
something but what's past and done.
pointing every finger at me.
I'm shameless, nameless, nothing, and noone now.
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
your eyes closed.
The water is rising up on me.
and I want to have faith to put away the dagger.
in the water.
You'll like this in
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this.
I tolerate you.
Cleanse and purge me
and sing your glory
All the way in.
I scramble to reach higher ground,
close enough so I can smell you.
So what you're trying to say
So how could I let this bring me
But my soul must be iron for my fear is naked.
There's release in this sodomy.
it won't be long now
Released in this sodomy.
There's a shadow just behind me,
You look so precious.
is you don't wanna play.
So sweet was your surrender
what's broken.
My piss and moans are the fuel that set my head on fire.
I've been baptized by your voice.
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy.
So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine,
and I'm back on my knees.
I will chew it up and leave,
You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
and let me in.
something but the past and done?
I have become my terror
Our guilt,our blame ,
who upon the finger rests.
There's no other choice.
when you're a stupid,dumb ass, beligerant fucker.
I am not innocent.
and just as undisturbing.
Trust in me and fall as well.
and my desire stolen and it makes me feel ugly.
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon.
shut up shut up shut up shut up
blood and flesh can be trusted.
is a cavern of treasures that
Thought I was high, and free.
lie, cheat, and steal.
Slipped right into your skin
I don't want to be dismal.
and sing your praise and glory.
You slid and crept away
and half as clear as reason.
and climb to a new place now.
I thought I was there
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind.
under for the third time.
Won't you come a bit closer,
I am just an imbecile.
All I knew and all I believed
For I am your witness that
You won't do what you'd like to do.
but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
The ground is breaking down right under me.
close enough so I can smell you.
This is love.
Far too comfortable.
You see.. shit adds up, now I'm dead inside.
Our blood, our fault.
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Don't pull it out.
as I smile and laugh and dance
noone has been to.
Waiting like a stalking butler
speaks from deep
and my throat wide open.
Thought I could break the circle if I
It brings us closer than
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious.
This is my love for you.
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,
gone under two times.
and twice as loud as reason.
It's twice as clear as heaven,
You can take it all.
Show me something
dying and cancer and crying.
All the way.
I have swallowed the poison you feed me ...
Trust me.
back to my knees again again again
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Too much, too far, too late to lie down now.
Thought I could wash the stains away
shit blood and cum on my hands.
I need you to feel this,
But I'm so comfortable.
I've got my hands bound,
take what's left and eat it.
I don't want to be hostile.
just before the son has come.
I will only complicate you.
Why can't we not be sober?
I'll die within your undertow.
I will work to elevate you
I will find a center in you.
that no longer comfort me.
and it's half as high as heaven
Take it all.
But I don't want to rot in an apathetic existance either.
but I survive on it,
Bring it out to take you back in.
Lay back and let me show you another way.
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?" And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust." And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.
suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine.
Let it go in.
I've come round full circle.
4 degrees warmer.
Noone told you to come.
Why can't we drink forever.
I was wrong.
I must arm myself to fight you
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
But you lie, cheat, and steal.
some order and sanity,
suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
I've been far too sympathetic.
And yet
If you knock me down I'll come back running,
Wander in and wandering.
I want to believe you,
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
We have become one
Got your hands bound, your head down,
My compassion is broken now. My will is eroded,
All the way in.
But still you stumble in stumbling.
Soon the water will come
For one sweet moment I am whole.
just enough to bring you down.
I was so young and vestal then,
Why don't you kill me,
making every promise empty,
I'm naked and fearless.
How can I tolerate you.
You are not innocent.
Euphoria.
I need to sleep a while.
it's cold and and black like silt on the riverbed.
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Get up. Now.
by making weapons out of my imperfections.
and it leaves me guilt fed, hatred fed, weakness fed..
Give in now
I'll kill what you want me to,
This changes everything.
You look so precious now.
beneath the cold black water.
at the bottom.
You're wading knee deep and going in.
Murder now the path called "must we"
So suffocate
the currents mouth below me opens up around me.
I need this to make me whole.
you're saturating me
But I'm dead inside.
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away.
I tried to keep ahold,
You crawled away from me.
Take it all in.
Take it up higher.
or something to comfort me.
I just want to start this over.
Come on .
Because I can see your back is turning.
and I feel ugly, and dead inside.
I'm back down. I'm in the undertow.
or get out while you can.
like the calm beneath castles,
Life's just too short to push it away.
We are born of One Breath, One Word.
You’re gonna happen again. That’s what I think.
Tears in my eyes chasing Ponce de Leon’s phantoms.
A 7empest will be just that.
Stay the reading of our swan song & epilogue.
Reach out and beyond.
Beating chest and drums. Beating tired bones again.
Acting all surprised when you’re caught in the lie.
Heated altercations we’ve never had, or so I’m told
Disputing intentions invites devastation.
Stir us from our wanton slumber. Mitigate our ruin.
It’s not unlike you.
Heavy shield down. Warrior struggling to remain relevant.
Child, release the light.
Immunity, long Overdue. Contagion, I exhale you
We are will and wonder, bound to recall – remember
Floating nescient we free fall through this boundlessness,
Naïve, I opened up to you, venom and mania.
But Bound to reach out and beyond this flesh, become Pneuma.
We are all One Spark, Sun becoming.
We go round one foot nailed down.
Every single one.
Wake up, remember –
Psychopathy. Don’t You dare point that at me.
Without evidence.
We know your nature.
Sound our dire reveille. Rouse all from our apathy, lest we cease to be.
Your veil now, lift away.
Acting all surprised when you’re caught in the lie.
Pray we Mitigate the ruin, calling all to arms and order.
Sound the dread Alarm through our primal body.
Calm before the torrent comes.
Control, your delusion. Insane and striking at random.
To the quickened dissolution.
Drifting through this boundlessness, this madness of our own making.
Your words to erase all the damage cannot.
A 7empest will be just that.
Spirit bound to this flesh, this guise, this mask, this dream.
Wake up now, child.
The Deceiver says, “You belong to me. You don’t wanna breath the light of the others.
My own mitosis, growing through division from mania.
Sound the reveille to be or not to be.
Feel the sting. Feeling time bearing down.
Call us all to arms and order.
Pneuma.
Bellow aloud, bold and proud, of where I’ve been. But here I am.
Follow the evidence. Look it dead in the eye. You are darkness.
Shame on you. Shame on you, now
It’s Elementary. Muster every fiber. Mobilize. Stay Alive
Child, wake up.
Free fall through our midnight, this epilogue of our own fable.
Bless this immunity.
We are all One Spark, Sun becoming.
Once invincible. Now the armor’s wearing thin.
Trying to Lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity.
Forfeit all control, you Poison, you Spectacle.
Fear the light. Fear the breath. Fear the others for eternity.”
Wake up, remember.
Call us all to arms and order.
But I hear them now. Inhale the clarity. I hear the venom in what you say.
Warrior struggling to remain consequential.
We are Spirit bound to this flesh.
Mitigate our ruin.
Psychopathy.
Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious tendencies.
Deceiver, chased away. A Long time coming.
Age old battle, mine. Weapon out and belly in.
Imagined interplay
Exorcise the Spectacle. Exorcise the malady.
Blameless, the 7empest must/will be just that.
It’s not unlike you. We know your nature.
Hearing Conversations we’ve never had.
Beating tired bones. Tripping through remember when.
Rise. Stay the grand finale.
Only the whispers from within.
Purge me and Evacuate the Venom & the Fear that binds me.
keep calm. Keepin it calm. Keep calm. FUCK. Here we go again
We are all One Spark, eyes full of wonder.
Victim of your uncertainty, and therefore your doubt’s not an option.
Heat lightning flash, but don’t blink. Misleading. Tranquility ruse.
Exorcize the disparate poison for eternity.
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems.
But the truth never got in my way before now.
Stir us from our wanton slumber.
Spirit…
We know better. It’s not unlike you.
Judge, Condemn, and banish any and everyone
Psychopathy.
I see you running.
Come, Our end, suddenly. All hail our lethargy. Concede Suddenly.
One Drive; To stay alive.
Yet guided by them all.
We are Born of One Breath, One Word.
Bellow aloud, bold and proud, of where I’ve been.
Now Contagion, I exhale you.
Calm before the 7empest comes to reign all over.
We’re not buying your dubious state of serenity.
We are born of One Breath, One Word.
Falling isn’t flying. Floating isn’t infinite…
Blame it all on the bastards when you’re blowin out.
But here I am, where I end.
Inoculated.
Warrior struggling to remain consequential.
Misleading me over and over.
Lurch into the fray. Weapon out and belly in.
False hope, perhaps,
Tales told of battles won, of things we’ve done, Caligula would grin.
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor.
Enumerate all that I’m to do. Calculating steps away from you.
Heedless in our slumber.
Misleading me over and over
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone.
This madness of our own making.
So filled with hope I can taste mythical fountains.
We know better. It’s not unlike you
Exhale. Expel. Recast my tale. Weave my allegorical elegy.
Exhale. Expel. Recast my tale. Weave my allegorical elegy.
Long in tooth and soul. Longing for another win.
Imagined interplay.
Psychopathy. Don’t You dare point that at me.
A 7empest must be true to its nature.
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
"Killed by the husband" ...
with Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Didn't have a life,
Move by will alone
Then they showed me something
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
Silly monkeys.
Shouldn't have to say it all again
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father.
God damn, shit the bed
Don't go tossin' your stones around
Fell at the hands of those movements that I wouldn't see
God damn, shit the bed!
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes,
Light the way or warm this
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way,
You practically raised the dead
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie 
Dabblin' all the way down
Who could deny you were the one who
with some orange slices
Benched along with patience and reason.
Feet cold and eyes red
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Then the X-Files being,
(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye
and me yelping...
Puzzled and amused.
Sunkist * and Sudafed
You must have been high!
Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
And give a listen
Other than tremble incessantly?
All sorta terrifying
We all feed on tragedy.
I don't wanna be all alone
Pure as we begin
Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me. What's the difference?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
What have I done
Pure as we begin
Liar, lawyer - mirror, for you what's the difference?
Not like you.
It's time now!
"Drowned by the ocean" ...
You believed ...
Doctor: Good morning, I'm Dr. Watson. How are you today? How are you today? Look son, you're in a safe place, we want to help you, in whatever way we can. But you need to talk to us, we can't help you otherwise. Now, what's happened? Tell me everything.
Carnivore and voyeur
Damn my eyes!
So it is, so it's always been ...
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school.
Feast like a sultan, I do
Don't even know what that means
See, my heart is pounding
(With the) burden of proof tossed upon the believers.
To write it down for all the world to see.
Devour to survive
Angels on the sideline,
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose.
Judith Marie, unconditional one.
I'm out of my head
Sing to the death rattle.
Finally, it's my lucky day
Angels on the sideline,
You must've been high!
To be a son to an angel?
Such a heavy burden now to be the One
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
When you pissed all over my black kettle.
Then immobilized.
Wondering where this tug of war will end.
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Doctor: A moment? What's the question?
Angels on the sideline again,
Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Up to my neck, soon to drown.
Father blessed them all with reason,
You all feel the same so why can't we just admit it?
Here from a kings mountain view
And this wasn't all in my head.
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending,
But you changed that all for me
Didn't have a life,
Shine down upon the many.
Gotta divide it all right in two.
"She never told a lie,
the Deadhead Chemistry
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground.
'til you pull it out. boy,
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
to see in a place like this.
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough;
With somniferous almond eyes
Breathe in union
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
See the Dead ain't touring
But never lived one.
and some fetal spooning,
Eye on the TV
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
And this is what they choose?
Angels on the sideline again,
Fuckin' hypocrite
In love with the dark side I'd found
Listen to the tales and romanticize,
Like the time Dave floated away
Y'all sound like Peanuts parents?
Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position.
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
You, my piece of mind, my all, my center,
Now they're all confused.
Then he looked right through me
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Nor brightest of stories told
Silence, legion. Stay out of my way.
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
that I pissed my fuckin' pants."
And where there's one they're bound to divide it right in two.

Forge a blade to slay the stranger
You'd better listen.
Give me my, give me my wings!"
You must have been so high
Look Him in the eye, look Him in the eye, and tell Him:
Spare me.
You'd better...
A light in your eyes
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun.
when a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Tempted the devil with my song
Swore to crush his bones
They fight till they die over words, polarizing.
You must have been out your mind
To be worthy?
Wish it all away
You believed in me
Yet it was you who prayed for me.
Silence, legion. Save your poison.
Alrighty, then ... picture this if you will.
the One who will deliver the message.
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
I would
Shine on benevolent sun
Where there's one you're bound to divide it right in two.
So who are you to wave your finger?
Shine until the two become one
Weepin' shades of indigo
Shed without a reason 
Frown out your one face, but with the other (you)
You're the only one who can hold your head up high,
Can't remember what they said
Shelter turned to home
I can't breathe right now!
Shit the bed again ...
Throw to stay the stranger
Must remember to write it down
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child,
So what have I done
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
They fight till they die over sea, over air,
Part vampire, part warrior,
"I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
Silly monkeys.
and stopping right at my Birkenstocks,
Doctor: You've got the chart?
When you pissed all over my black kettle.
Difficult to dance 'round this one
Spark becomes a flame
Can't remember what they said
and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip,
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
Doctor: What's the problem?
Stare at the transmittal.
Eye balls deep in muddy waters
That's my kind of story
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here.
On treasures and flesh never few
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
Shake your fists at the gates saying:
Flame becomes a fire
Please forgive this selfish question, but
Can't remember what they said
Neither the brave nor bold
like one would hope but never really expect
The devil and his had me down
Nurse: Right here.
So impersonal
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Stare like a junkie into the TV
You'd better...
None of us have actually been there.
It was so real,
Nurse: No sir.
You believe me, don't you?
Why did Father* give these humans free will?
Gotta divide it all right in two.
He had me crying out,
Shine until the two become one
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
Pure as we begin
Shine down upon the broken
'Cause this shit never happens to me
You were the light and the way they'll only read about.
It's gotta be
Leave as we come in
This is so real
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.
And after calming me down
Move by will alone
Kangaroo done hung the jury with the innocent
I'm out of my head
Nurse: Excuse me, doctor, do you have a moment?
Nurse: That is the problem: we're not sure.
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground.
just trying to hold on one more day.
How we'd follow the path of the hero.
You...
Difficult to see you in this light.
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Pure as we come in
"Fuck me
You're going home.
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
Who are you to wave your finger?
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle.
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw,
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Another day and season
Here from the wild dream come true
Nurse: More of a situation, a gentleman in Exam 3.
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent.
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance,
I can't breathe right now!

So full of it
Ganja? P-lease!

Please forgive this bold suggestion, but
Oh, what are they going to do when the lights go down
Then I might as well be gone...
... well might have told a lie,
And can anyone tell me why
My time now!
Like I woke up in Wonderland.
Begged like a hooker all night long
Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Typical.
Strapped down [to] my bed
Pure as we begin
It's no fun til someone dies.
"I've come home now!
Here we have a stone
And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me;
Why can't we just admit it?
Pure as light, return to one
If I could
A passionate spirit
You must have been high
But I would wish it all, away
Wanna wish it all away
Why can't we just admit it?
Pure as we begin
Difficult to see you in this light
Lifted me up, turned me round
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations;
(If) wants and needs divide me
You believed in movements none could see.
Fight till they die over sun, over sky,
Pure as we begin
They fight till they die over blood, over love,
How we rise to the height of our halo.
See, my heart is racing
Move by will alone
He said, "You are the Chosen One,

Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!"
Much better you than I.
Give them thumbs, they forge a blade,
Holy fucking shit!
Hands to the sky cryin "why, oh why?"
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Feet cold [and] eyes red
Light our way, benevolent sun.
Cause I need to watch things die from a distance
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home."
and all I could think was:
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
'cause tragedy thrills me
If they should compromise the fulcrum:
Wish it away
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Divided, I'll wither away
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents.
Kangaroo be stoned. He's guilty as the government.
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?
Nurse: No ID, nothing, and he won't speak to anybody.
This is so real
See, they took me by the hand
Your desire to believe in
And got what I wanted all along
Shine down upon the severed
You must have been outta your head
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery.
Don't look at me like I am a monster
Spark becomes a flame
Shine on benevolent sun
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Doctor: Name?
Damn my eyes!
Move by will alone
Drum on grave and ground
Who are you to wave your finger?
(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye
"Shot by his own son" ...
It's like blood to a vampire.
Flame becomes a fire
So if I could I'd wish it all away
Hey ...
Shine on forever
You'd better...
Doctor: Hmm... not much here, is there?
Take whatever we desire
Watches him die,
The universe is hostile

Whatever flavor it happens to be
High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground.
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Like an apparition, [that]
I don't even know where to begin.
Weepin' shades of indigo
Please believe what I've just said!
Nurse: No doctor, no obvious physical trauma, vitals are stable.
Credulous at best
If I thought I'd lose you just one day
Now it's time for us to let you go.

You must have been out your mind
Can't remember what they said
Wish it away
Boundless and open
I only pray, Heaven knows when to lift you out.
Uncompromised
You all need it too - don't lie.
But I forgot my pen
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.
I need to watch things die from a good safe distance
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
God damn, shit the bed.
You are the light and way that they will only read about.
Broken
But, enough about the collective Judas.
Here we have a stone
I can't remember what they said to me
No prize that could hold sway
But surely saved one."
They chose me!!!

Foot in mouth and head up ass
Your way home ...
Baffled and confused.

Will I ever be coming down?
You must've been...
